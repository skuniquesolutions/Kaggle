    "The mean score represents the average performance of your model across the different folds of cross-validation. In this case, the mean score is approximately -30.41, which indicates that, on average, the model's predictions have a mean squared error (MSE) of around 30.41.\n",

    "The standard deviation of the scores measures the variability or spread of the model's performance across different folds. A smaller standard deviation suggests that the model's performance is relatively consistent across folds, while a larger standard deviation suggests greater variability.\n",

    "Overall, a mean score of -30.41 suggests that the model is doing a decent job at capturing the underlying patterns in the data for your regression task, and the standard deviation of 6.58 gives you an idea of the degree of variability in its performance. If this performance meets your requirements and expectations, then the model is likely a suitable choice for your task.\n"
